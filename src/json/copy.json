The app is based on my extended version of the [JSON Resume protocol](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).  It uses SASS and Bourbon for CSS preprocessing, and the following 3rd-party Javascript libraries: Browserify, marked, Zepto (instead of jQuery), lodash (intead of Underscore), Exoskeleton (instead of Backbone), Backbone-Associations, React, and Flux.  It also uses a few Javascript modules I wrote myself: [searchGuesser](https://github.com/azaslavsky/searchGuesser), [sneakyBars](https://github.com/azaslavsky/sneakyBars), and [backbone-hashMate](https://github.com/azaslavsky/backbone-hashMate)."

It is also registered as a [JSON Resume](http://registry.jsonresume.org/alexzaslavsky).  Finally, the entire JSON set from which this app is populated is available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/azaslavsky/resume/tree/master/json).",
